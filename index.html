                    C is a general-purpose programming language. It has been closely associated
                    with the UNIX system where it was developed, since both the system and most of the programs that run
                    on it are written in C. The language, however, is not tied to any one operating system or machine;
                    and although it has been called "system programming language" because it is useful for writing
                    compilers and operating systems, it has been used equally well to write major programs in many
                    different domains.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With C, our aim is tho show the essential elements of the language in real
                    programs, but without getting bogged down in details, rules, and exceptions. We want to get you as
                    quickly as possible to the point where you can write useful programs, and to do that we have to
                    concentrate on the basics; variables and constants, data types, declarations, operators, statements,
                    and loops.

                    The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in
                    it. The first program to write is the same for all languages:
                </p>
                <pre class="snippet">Printing "hello world"</pre>
                <p>
                    This is the big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create
                    the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output
                    went. In C, the program to print "hello, world"
                    is:

                    <pre class="pre"><button onclick="CopyToClipboard('hello'); changeToolText()" onmouseover="makeVisible()" onmouseout="revertToolText()" class="copy-btn"><i class="bi bi-clipboard" id="copy" ></i></button><div id="tool-text">Copy to clipboard</div><code class="pre-code" id="hello">#include &#x3c;stdio.h&#x3e;

                        int main() {
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("Hello World\n");
                        }
                    </code></pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just how to run this program depends on the sysyem you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX
                    operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in ".c" such as hello.c, then
                    compile it with the command
                <pre class="snippet">cc hello.c</pre> and execute with
                <pre class="snippet">a.out</pre> On a recommended program called <a
                    href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/" target="_blank" class="link">Dev C++</a>, you
                can just simply press F11. If you haven't
                botched anything, such as omitting a character or mispelling something, the compilation will proceed
                silently.

            <header>Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>In C, all variables must be declared before they are used, usually at the
                    beginning of the function before any executable statements. A <i>declaration</i> announces, the
                    properties of variables; it consists of a type name and a list of variables such
                    as

                <pre class="pre"><code class="pre-code">int fahr, celcius;
                            int lower, upper, step;</code></pre>

                </p>

                <p>
                    Variable names are made up of letters and digits; the first character must
                    be a letter. The underscore "_" counts as a letter; it is sometimes useful for improving the
                    readability of long variable names. It's wise to choose variable names that are related to the
                    purpose of the variable, and that are unlikely to get mixed up typographically. We tend to use short
                    names for local variables, especially loop indices, and longer names for external variables.

            <header>Data Types</header>
            <article>
                <p> C provides several basic data types such as:</p>
                <div class="data-type">
                    <p>int</p>
                    <p>integer</p>

                    <p>character-a single byte</p>
                </div>
                <div class="data-type">
                    <p>short</p>
                    <p>short integer</p>

                </div>
                <div class="data-type">
                    <p>double</p>
                    <p>double-precision floating point</p>

                    All variables must be declared before use, although certain declarations can
                    be made implicitly by context. A declaration specifies a type, and contain a list of one or more
                    variables of that type, as in

                <pre class="pre"><code class="pre-code">int lower, upper, step;
                            char c, line[1000];
                        </code></pre>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Variables can be distributed among declarations in any fashion; the list above could equally well be
                    written as
                </p>

                <pre class="pre"><code class="pre-code">int lower;
                            int upper;
                            int step;
                            char c;
                            char line[1000];
                        </code></pre>

                <p>
                    This latter form takes more space, but is convenient for adding a comment to each declaration or for
                    subsequent modifications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Variable may also be initialized in its declaration. If the naem is
                    followed by an equals sign and an expression, the expression serves as an initializer, as in

                <pre class="pre"><code class="pre-code">char esc = '\\';
                            int i = 0;
                            int limit = MAXLINe + 1;
                            float eps = 1.0e-5;
                        </code></pre>

                    The binary arithmetic operators are +, -, *, /, and the modulus operator %.
                    Integer division truncates any fractional part. The expression
                </p>
                <pre class="snippet">x % y</pre>
                <p>
                    produces the remainder when x is divided by y, and thus is zero when y
                    divides x
                    exactly. For example, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, except that
                    years
                    divisible by 400 <i>are</i> leap years. Therefore
                </p>

                <pre class="pre"><code class="pre-code">if((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || year & 400 == 0)
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("%d is a leap year\n", year);
                        else
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printf("%d is not a leap year\n", year);
                    </code></pre>


                <p>
                    The % operator cannot be applied to float or double. The direction of truncation for / and the sign
                    of the result for % are machine-dependent for negative operands, as is the action taken on overflow
                    or underflow. The binary + and - operators have the same precedence, which is lower than the
                    precedence of *, /, and %, which is in turn lower than unary + and -.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The relational operators are
                <pre class="snippet">&gt;&#9;&gt;=&#9;&lt;&#9;=</pre>They all have the same precedence. Just below them
                in precedence
                are the equality operators:
                <pre class="snippet">==&#9;!=</pre>
                </p>

                    The if-else statement is used to express decisions. Formally, the syntax is
                <pre class="pseudo"><code>if (<i>expression</i>)
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>statement<sub>1</sub></i>

                <p>
                    where the else part is optional. The <i>expression</i> is evaluated; if it is true (that is, if
                    <i>expression</i> has a non-zero value), <i>statement<sub>1</sub></i> is executed. If it is false
                    (<i>expression</i> is zero) and if there is an else part, <i>statement<sub>2</sub></i> is executed
                    instead.

                    In the code, the <i>expression</i> is evaluated. If it is non-zero, <i>statement</i> is executed and
                    <i>expression</i> is re-evaluated. This cycle continues until <i>expression</i> becomes zero, at
