# Technical-Documentation
The C programming language documentation

## Backstory
In my first and second semesters, I had to learn C and C++. During that time I bought a book titled [_The C Programming Language_](https://www.google.co.id/books/edition/The_C_Programming_Language/OpJ_0zpF7jIC?hl=en&gbpv=0), written by the creators of C programming language themself: Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. I barely touched that book, so I thought I could make good use of it by making documentation based on it.

## Development
This project was made with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
- [Google Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons)
- [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)

With contents taken from:
- [_The C Programming Language_](https://www.google.co.id/books/edition/The_C_Programming_Language/OpJ_0zpF7jIC?hl=en&gbpv=0) by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie

Challenges:
- I wanted the code I wrote to be automatically colored just like it is in almost every text editor. After a few searches, I found highlight.js and it can get the job done easily. This library automatically detects and colors the code you wrote and we can use custom themes provided by the library.
- Took me quite a lot of time to create a copy to the clipboard button. The method I used to do so is old-fashioned. It's been deprecated and isn't recommended to be used anymore, but **document.execCommand("copy");** still works in Chrome. In the meantime, I haven't tried to find a better approach.
- Learned how to change browsers' scrollbar style.
- Learned how to make fancier hover styles (you can see it at the navbar).
